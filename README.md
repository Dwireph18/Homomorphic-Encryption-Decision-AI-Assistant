Homomorphic Encryption Decision AI Assistant
Aurora Cruci and Dwireph Parmar
Team CR7

Project Description:
This Python program uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API calls to assist users in selecting a fully
homomorphic encryption scheme that best suits their needs. The program directs an interactive
session with the user, prompting GPT-4 to ask multiple-choice questions based on predefined
data (the implementation usage table) about different encryption schemes. It adapts to the user
input, remembering the history of the conversation so that it can produce more effective output.
There are no predefined questions or hard-coded statistical analysis; the AI is trained using the
provided data and prompted to act in the desired manner. The program is successful both when
explicitly choosing all corresponding answers to a particular scheme, and when being more
ambiguous with the values but still hinting at a particular scheme. There are no known bugs in
the code.

Project Set-Up:
Ensure you have the “openai” Python package installed. Additionally, the file needs an OpenAI
API key to run, which I assume you have, and can be implemented in the terminal with “export
OPENAI_API_KEY=’your key here’.”

Team Member Contribution:
Aurora– I fully planned, programmed, and put together the entire assignment. I made the
slideshow, recorded and trimmed the presentation, wrote the README, and created the
implementation usage table. I am responsible for all of the work, except for my partner’s part in
the presentation.
Dwireph– Dwireph tried to troubleshoot and debug the code on a few occasions, and he
presented his share of the presentation. He consulted with me about the work, and about our
current progress on the project.

Comment About Lateness:
As you already know, this project is three days late. Both myself and my partner work (he
full-time and I part-time), and were very preoccupied with finals, other projects, and other
obligations. This is no excuse, but it is an explanation for why both of us struggled to complete
the project on time. I emailed you regarding my personal difficulty juggling the project alone,
which remained to be true in all aspects of the assignment. I completed the best quality work I
could, and I understand any point deductions that must be made. Additionally, thank you for your
kind email response.
